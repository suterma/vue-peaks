A lightweight Vue wrapper around the [bbc/peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js) audio waveform UI component.

![Image](https://github.com/suterma/vue-peaks/blob/main/vue-peaks-example-ui.png)

vue-peaks aims to simplify the use of [peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js/) in a [Vue3]( https://vuejs.org/) environment. It provides a [Single File Component (SFC)](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html), AudioPeaks.

Explore the [live examples](https://suterma.github.io/vue-peaks/).

# Installation

```sh
npm install vue-peaks
# peer dependencies of peaks.js
npm install konva
npm install waveform-data
```

Installing vue-peaks also installs [peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js/) as a dependency. However, peaks.js uses [Konva](https://konvajs.org/) and [waveform-data](https://github.com/bbc/waveform-data.js) as peer dependencies, so you must also install those modules.

# How to use

## Basic examples
vue-peaks provides three modes of operation:

*   **Simple mode**: just set the media URL, and all views are automatically rendered by default
*   **Slot mode**: the media element and additional views are provided using named slots
*   **External mode**: the media element and additional views are referenced by id or HTML element references

#### Just using a media source URL ("simple" mode)

By default, the [AudioPeaks Vue component](https://github.com/suterma/vue-peaks/blob/main/src/components/AudioPeaks.vue) template has a new audio element, with the given source URL, and both view panes (overview and zoom, which are rendered with a default size) and a controls pane. A new audio context is created and used to compute the waveform.

```
import AudioPeaks from 'vue-peaks/src/components/AudioPeaks.vue';
<AudioPeaks src='https://domain/file.mp3' />
```

#### Providing a media element ("slot" mode)

To provide your own media element, just place it inside the AudioPeaks element (a.k.a. the slot). Vue-peaks will use the first audio element in the slot. A new audio context is created and used to compute the waveform.

```
<AudioPeaks>
  <span>You can also add additional HTML content.</span>
  <audio controls style='width: 100%;'>
    <source src='https://domain/file.mp3' />
  </audio>
</AudioPeaks>
```

#### Using a specified media element ("external" mode)

If you already have an existing media element, you can reference it by it's (unique) id, or as an HTMLMediaElement object. A new audio context is created and used to compute the waveform.

There are also properties available for overview area and the zoom view area.

```
<audio controls id='externalMediaElement'>
  <source src='https://domain/file.mp3' />
</audio>
<div><span class='tag is-danger is-large'>
    Using the external media element above.</span></div>
<AudioPeaks mediaElementId='externalMediaElement'>
</AudioPeaks>
```
