A lightweight Vue wrapper around the [bbc/peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js) audio waveform UI component.

This project aims to simplify the use of peaks.js in a Vue3 environment.

# Installation

```sh
npm install vue-peaks
# peer dependencies of peaks.js
npm install konva
npm install waveform-data
```

Installing vue-peaks also installs Peaks.js as a dependency. However, Peaks.js uses [Konva](https://konvajs.org/) and [waveform-data](https://github.com/bbc/waveform-data.js) as peer dependencies, so you must also install those modules.

# How to use

## Basic examples

### Using a media source URL ("simple" mode)

```html
<AudioPeaks src="lidija_roos-not_for_sale.mp3" />
```

### Alternative with enclosed media element ("slot" mode)

To provide your own media element, just place it inside the AudioPeaks element (a.k.a. the slot). Vue-peaks will use the first audio element in the slot. A new audio context is created and used to compute the waveform.

```html
<AudioPeaks>
    <span>You can also add additional HTML content.</span>
    <audio
        controls
        style="width: 100%;"
    >
        <source
            src="https://suterma.github.io/vue-peaks/lidija_roos-not_for_sale.mp3"
        />
    </audio>
</AudioPeaks>
```

### Using a specified media element ("external" mode)

If you already have an existing media element, you can link it by it's (unique) id. A new audio context is created and used to compute the waveform.

```html
<div>
    <span>External media element:</span>
    <audio
        controls
        style="width: 100%;"
        id="mediaElement"
    >
        <source src="lidija_roos-not_for_sale.mp3" />
    </audio>
</div>
<AudioPeaks mediaElementId="mediaElement"> </AudioPeaks>
```
