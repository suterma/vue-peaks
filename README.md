A lightweight Vue wrapper around the [bbc/peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js) audio waveform UI component.

![Image](https://github.com/suterma/vue-peaks/blob/main/vue-peaks-example-ui.png?raw=true)

vue-peaks aims to simplify the use of [peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js/) in a [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) environment. It provides a single component, `AudioPeaks`.

Explore the [live examples](https://suterma.github.io/vue-peaks/).

# Installation

```sh
npm install vue-peaks --save
```

Installing vue-peaks also installs [peaks.js (version 3)](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js/) as a dependency. Additionally, peaks.js uses [Konva (version 8 or 9)](https://konvajs.org/) and [waveform-data (version 4)](https://github.com/bbc/waveform-data.js) as peer dependencies; these will get installed with vue-peaks, if not already available.

# How to use

## Basic examples

vue-peaks provides three modes of operation:

- **Simple mode**: just set the media URL, and all views are automatically rendered by default
- **Slot mode**: the media element and additional views are provided using named slots
- **External mode**: the media element and additional views are referenced by id or HTML element references

Import the component:

```
import { AudioPeaks } from 'vue-peaks';
// default styles for the AudioPeaks component
import 'vue-peaks/dist/style.css';
```

Note: Even if you do not use the default (or any other) styles, the overview and zoomview panes still do have a small minimum size set.

Currently, the package does not properly export types, see issue [#17](https://github.com/suterma/vue-peaks/issues/17). Alternatively you can also directly include the vue component as SFC:

```
import AudioPeaks from 'vue-peaks/src/components/AudioPeaks.vue';
// default styles for the AudioPeaks component are already contained in the SFC
```

#### Simple mode

By default, the [AudioPeaks Vue component](https://github.com/suterma/vue-peaks/blob/main/src/components/AudioPeaks.vue) template creates a new audio element, with the given source URL, and both view panes (overview and zoom, which are rendered with a default size) and a controls pane. A new audio context is created and used to compute the waveform.

```
<AudioPeaks src='https://lib.replayer.app/your-light-by-lidija-roos.mp3' />
```

#### Slot mode

To provide your own media element, just place it inside the `AudioPeaks` element (a.k.a. the slot). Vue-peaks will use the first media element in the slot. A new audio context is created and used to compute the waveform.

```
<AudioPeaks>
  <span>You can also add additional HTML content.</span>
  <audio controls>
    <source src='https://lib.replayer.app/your-light-by-lidija-roos.mp3' />
  </audio>
</AudioPeaks>
```

#### Using a specified media element ("external" mode)

If you already have an existing media element, you can reference it by it's (unique) id, or as an HTMLMediaElement object. A new audio context is created and used to compute the waveform.

There are also properties available for the overview area and the zoom view area.

```
<audio controls id='externalMediaElement'>
  <source src='https://lib.replayer.app/your-light-by-lidija-roos.mp3' />
</audio>
<div><span>
    Using the external media element above.</span></div>
<AudioPeaks mediaElementId='externalMediaElement'>
</AudioPeaks>
```

# Troubleshooting

**Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'isCE')**
When you use Webpack and locally link to the vue-peaks library, make sure vue is not included twice. See https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/4478#issuecomment-912235940

Your vue.config.js should look like

```
const { defineConfig } = require('@vue/cli-service')
const path = require('path') //add

module.exports = defineConfig({
  transpileDependencies: true,
  chainWebpack(config) {
    config.resolve.symlinks(false) //add
    config.resolve.alias.set( 'vue', path.resolve('./node_modules/vue')) // add
  },
})
```

# Build & Development

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and publish on GitHub pages

```sh
# cleanup
rm -rf dist
npm run build
# to publish to GitHub Pages (requires committing and pushing the build in the /dist folder)
git add dist -f
git commit -m 'built for gh-pages'
git push
npm run publish-gh-pages
```

### Compile for Production an publish as Library

- Update version
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Disable the App mode and enable the [library mode](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode)
  - in `vite.config.ts`
    - uncomment the `resolve` import
    - uncomment the `lib` property

```sh
# cleanup
rm -rf dist
npm run build-lib
# to publish to npm
npm publish
```

- Change back to App mode

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```
